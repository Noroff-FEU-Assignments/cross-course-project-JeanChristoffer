    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">I would inform the client about security practices that have been proven to be efficient.</p>
        <ol><strong>This are:</strong>
            <br><li><strong>Sanitization of data</strong><br>
                Make sure the data your system accepts is in the correct format. 
                This can be achieved in for example NodeJS. Which offers a "sanitize-html package". The sanitize() method is then used to remove any unwanted elements. </li>
                <li><strong>Authorization protocol</strong><br>
                    Use a well-known and trusted authorization protocol like OneLogin which is hard to crack.</li>
                <li><strong>Bounty system</strong><br>
                    A bounty system for your security protocols is also a good solution. This involves hiring white hat hackers to test your system’s security and find vulnerabilities in your system. 
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>CI/CD</strong><br>
                    CI/CD which stands for Continuous Deployment/Continuous Integration. This process checks every change against security checks. if the changes does not pass the checks gets flagged and prevents the code from going to production.</li>
                    <li><strong>Network engineer</strong><br>
                       Hire a good network engineer. They are tasked with protecting the exchange of packets across the network.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Timeout session</strong><br>
                      Implement a timeout session so employees don’t have their credentials or other sensitive data visible in the browser for an extended period of time.</li>
        </ol>
