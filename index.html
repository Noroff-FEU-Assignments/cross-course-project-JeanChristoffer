    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">I would inform the client about the most common security threats which are: Cross-site scripting, SQL injection, and Cross-site request forgery. 
        I would then advise the team about web security practices that are proven to be efficient and works. 
        <ol><strong>These are</strong>
            <li><strong>Sanitization of data</strong><br>
                This focus is on accepting data systems in the right format. This can be achieved in for example NodeJS which has a sanitized-HTML package. Other third-party solutions like Object Related Mapping are also good for preventing SQL attacks.</li>
                <li><strong>Authorization protocol</strong><br>
                    Use a well-known authorization protocol like OneLogin which is hard to crack.</li>


                <li><strong>Bounty system</strong><br>
                    A bounty system for your security protocols is also a good solution. This involves hiring white hat hackers to test your system’s security and find vulnerabilities in your system. 
                    A well-protected system will also give you respect among the hacker community.</li>
                    <li><strong>Network engineer</strong><br>
                        Hire a good network engineer. The network is a hub of connected nodes either wireless or wired. And protecting the exchange of data across the network is what a network engineer is tasked with protecting. 
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Timeout session</strong><br>
                        I would also recommend implementing a timeout session so employees don’t have their credentials visible in the browser for an extended period of time.</li>
        </ol>
